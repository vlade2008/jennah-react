Classes

Airline / Hotel Reservation System -
 Create a reservation system which books airline
 seats or hotel rooms. It charges various rates for
 particular sections of the plane or hotel. Example,
 first class is going to cost more than coach. Hotel
 rooms have penthouse suites which cost more. Keep track
 of when rooms will be available and can be scheduled.


Text

Fizz Buzz - Write a program that prints the
numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of
three print “Fizz” instead of the number
and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”.
 For numbers which are multiples of both three
 and five print “FizzBuzz”.

Reverse a String - Enter a string and the program will reverse it and print it out.


Count Vowels - Enter a string and the program
counts the number of vowels in the text. For
added complexity have it report a sum of each vowel found.


Check if Palindrome - Checks if the string entered by
the user is a palindrome. That is that it
reads the same forwards as backwards like “racecar”
